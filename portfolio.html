                    Your wedding photos are going to be one of your most cherished possessions. What’s not to love about the celebration of love between two people, with a set of photos to remember the event by? However, photos are limited. While they capture a pivotal chapter in your story, there’s a lot they don’t tell. Which is where a wedding film comes in. 
                    And not just any wedding film, but one by All Time Films. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We understand that your story started long before your wedding day. While it’s an important chapter in your story, it’s not your whole story, and we know this. We’re there to capture the fleeting moments that would otherwise be forgotten. 
                    We’re there to tell your backstory, to put your union in context, to make a romantic film about love with you as the main character.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wedding photos can bring back memories of your big day. But a wedding film will help you relive that special day, forever.  You don’t have to take our word for it, either. 
                    Below is a collection of films we made for other couples. Can we make one for you?

                                    Jeremiah is friendly, accommodating, and flexible. He has a great attitude and when he showed up on our wedding day he already felt like a friend (even though it was the first time we met him!). 
                                    Jeremiah is incredibly professional, has a very high work ethic, and even though we didn't live in the same state as him, he went above and beyond to enhance and simplify our videography experience. 
                                    Our wedding teaser video was done incredibly fast and left us all speechless - 
                                    we couldn't have imagined our special day being captured more perfectly! 12/10 recommend Jeremiah for ANY videography needs!”

                                    He listened to what My must haves were and delivered beyond expectation! 
                                    Every detail of our wedding was captured, all of the intimate moments, the decor, the whole venue, and the party! 
                                    My only wish is that he lived closer so we could use him to shoot our videos for work haha. He is super talented and was such a pleasure to be around and work with! Definitely gets 5 out of 5 stars!!!

                                    Working with Jeremiah- All Time Films was a breeze. Videography was not our priority at first however after seeing his work we knew we needed to have him at our wedding. 
                                    He was extremely professional, personable, and really took time to get to know us so that our wedding film captured our story. After our experience I now HIGHLY recommend hiring him as a videographer. The style of All Time Films is so different from any other wedding videos we saw because it’s unique to the couple. 
                                    It tells a story, YOUR story, and that’s what you want from your videographer.

                                    I can not say enough about Jeremiah. 
                                    I was expecting a wedding video but he calls these wedding films and oh my goodness is that appropriate... 
                                    Our film is a cinematic masterpiece. Through the stress and nerves of the wedding day it is hard to really breathe it all in, 
                                    but every time I watch our film I am shocked at just how beautiful it all was, how blissful we looked, and how much fun all our guests were having. 
                                    His focus is on storytelling and I was a little concerned that our story wasn't dramatic enough to be told. 
                                    Jeremiah made sure to prove me wrong on that. I also really wanted to incorporate my late father into my day and was hoping he could involve this in our film. He captured all the intricate details I had worked so hard on to honor my father that day. 
                                    This meant so much. His incorporation of my dad's story into ours not only made my heart happy, but it will make the video that much more special for loved ones to see and for our children to see someday.  
                                    He is a kind and happy soul whose presence honestly just made the day better in general!
