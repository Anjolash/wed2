                                        Working with Jeremiah- All Time Films was a breeze. 
                                        Videography was not our priority at first however after seeing his work we knew we needed to have him at our wedding. 
                                        He was extremely professional, personable, and really took time to get to know us so that our wedding film captured our story. After our experience I now HIGHLY recommend hiring him as a videographer. The style of All Time Films is so different from any other wedding videos we saw because it’s unique to the couple. 
                                        It tells a story, YOUR story, and that’s what you want from your videographer.

                                        We get to watch and remember what each moment felt like that day, but also get to watch our loved ones have an incredible time celebrating us. Our video captured everything that mattered and nothing that didn’t. 
                                        Everyone we’ve had the chance to show the video to has said that they feel like they are there and are so incredibly impressed with Jeremiah‘s talent the way we are.

                                        I can not say enough about Jeremiah. I was expecting a wedding video but he calls these wedding films and oh my goodness is that appropriate... 
                                        Our film is a cinematic masterpiece. Through the stress and nerves of the wedding day it is hard to really breathe it all in, but every time I watch our film I am shocked at just how beautiful it all was, 
                                        how blissful we looked, and how much fun all our guests were having. His focus is on storytelling and I was a little concerned that our story wasn't dramatic enough to be told. 
                                        Jeremiah made sure to prove me wrong on that. I also really wanted to incorporate my late father into my day and was hoping he could involve this in our film. He captured all the intricate details I had worked so hard on to honor my father that day. This meant so much. 
                                        His incorporation of my dad's story into ours not only made my heart happy, but it will make the video that much more special for loved ones to see and for our children to see someday.  
                                        He is a kind and happy soul whose presence honestly just made the day better in general!

                                        We are absolutely BLOWN away by this video and will watch it until the end of time. 
                                        His work absolutely exceeded our expectations and was hands-down our best wedding investment. 
                                        We will be able to go back and watch this in the years to come and relive all of these beautiful moments that were caught so perfectly. 
                                        Don’t think about it, just book with him.”

                                        “We found Jeremiah through a FB Ad and from our very first interaction with him, we were totally impressed. 
                                        Jeremiah is friendly, accommodating, and flexible. He has a great attitude and when he showed up on our wedding day he already felt like a friend (even though it was the first time we met him!). 
                                        Jeremiah is incredibly professional, has a very high work ethic, and even though we didn't live in the same state as him, he went above and beyond to enhance and simplify our videography experience. 
                                        Our wedding teaser video was done incredibly fast and left us all speechless - 
                                        we couldn't have imagined our special day being captured more perfectly! 12/10 recommend Jeremiah for ANY videography needs!”
